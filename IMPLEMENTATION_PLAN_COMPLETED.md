- **Import Conflict Resolution**: Renamed `mcp/` to `financial_mcp/` to avoid conflicts with ADK's MCP dependency

### ‚úÖ 2. Agent Conversion
- **SpendingAnalyzerADK**: Complete ADK-based spending analysis agent
- **GoalPlannerADK**: ADK-based goal planning and tracking agent  
- **AdvisorADK**: ADK-based comprehensive financial advisor agent
- **Custom Toolsets**: Created specialized toolsets for data retrieval and analysis

### ‚úÖ 3. Orchestration & Coordination
- **ADKOrchestrator**: Advanced orchestrator with async execution and parallel processing
- **Workflow Management**: Comprehensive workflow coordination with error handling
- **A2A Communication**: Agent-to-Agent collaboration using ADK patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Timeout protection and graceful error handling

### ‚úÖ 4. UI Integration
- **Framework Selector**: Added dropdown to choose between Original and ADK implementations
- **Dual Support**: UI seamlessly supports both frameworks
- **Result Display**: Created `display_adk_response()` for ADK-specific formatting
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear labeling of which framework generated results

### ‚úÖ 5. Testing & Validation
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: `test_adk_implementation.py` validates all ADK functionality
- **Import Testing**: Verified all ADK agent imports work correctly
- **Database Integration**: Confirmed ADK agents can access the database properly
- **Functional Testing**: Validated ADK agents produce meaningful results

### ‚úÖ 6. Documentation & Comparison
- **ADK_COMPARISON.md**: Comprehensive comparison document covering:
  - Architecture differences
  - Code structure comparison
  - Performance analysis
  - Use case recommendations
  - Educational value assessment
  - Migration considerations

## üìä Key Achievements

### üéì Educational Value
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Students can now compare both approaches in the same codebase
- **Real-world Framework**: Experience with Google's production-ready ADK
- **Best Practices**: Learn both custom and framework-based agent development
- **Performance Insights**: Understand trade-offs between approaches

### üöÄ Technical Features
- **Parallel Processing**: ADK implementation supports concurrent agent execution
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Foundation for enterprise-scale deployments
- **Modern Patterns**: Async/await patterns with proper resource management

### üîß Implementation Quality
- **Production Ready**: ADK implementation follows enterprise standards
- **Maintainable Code**: Clean separation of concerns and modular design
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit and integration tests included
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation for both approaches

## üéØ Student Learning Outcomes

After exploring both implementations, students will understand:

1. **Custom Agent Development**:
   - Object-oriented agent design patterns
   - Manual orchestration and workflow management
   - Direct LLM integration techniques
   - Custom error handling strategies

2. **Framework-based Development**:
   - Google ADK configuration and usage
   - Built-in tool and orchestration patterns
   - Enterprise-grade agent development
   - Cloud-native scaling considerations

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - When to choose custom vs. framework approaches
   - Performance and scalability trade-offs
   - Development velocity considerations
   - Maintenance and updates implications

## üß™ How to Use Both Implementations

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
streamlit run ui/main.py
```

### 2. Select Framework
In the AI Analysis tab, use the dropdown to choose:
- **"Original Custom Implementation"** - Uses the original agents
- **"Google ADK Implementation"** - Uses the new ADK agents

### 3. Compare Results
Run the same analysis with both frameworks and compare:
- Response structure and formatting
- Performance and speed
- Analysis quality and depth
- Error handling behavior

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
# Test original implementation
python test_integration.py

# Test ADK implementation  
python test_adk_implementation.py
```
