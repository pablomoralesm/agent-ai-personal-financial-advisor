# 🎯 Project Creation Prompt

This document contains the exact prompt used to create this entire Agentic AI Financial Advisor project from scratch using Cursor AI. This demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development and can be used to recreate or extend the project.

## 📋 Original Prompt

```
I'm building a small sample app for an Agentic AI class. The app's goal is to provide tailored financial advice to customers. 

The app should demostrate:

Agents:
 - SpendingAnalyzerAgent: Reviews spending habits
 - GoalPlannerAgent: Helps set savings/investment goals
 - AdvisorAgent: Recommends actions.
MCP:  Stores customer profile, goals, and advice history.
A2A: Agents collaborate to refine recommendations

Development language should be Python. It should utilize best practices and be as pedagogic as possible.

The UI should allow the user to easily enter transactions and goals, run the agents and show recommendations.

It should be built using Python and the following:
 - Streamlist for the UI
 - Google ADK
 - Gemini LLM
 - MySQL database thru MCP

Create a plan to implement this sample app. 
```
